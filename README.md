# Mohr-Coulomb-Failure-Criterion
Used to find the shear parameters of the rock such as friction angle, cohesion, and developing the failure envelope
Just insert the input values (principal stresses) and run.
Use Basic fitting tool to find the line in Fig 1, the parameters are calculated and shown in the output though.
Depending on the number of stress pairs (4 used in this code), you may need to add/remove plot lines in the plots section of the code.
